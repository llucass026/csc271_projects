    <h1>WALK BY FAITH</h1>
    <p1>Wear your Beliefs Proudly</p1>

    <br/>



    <br/>
    <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
    <p2>The story of Walk by Faith began with a vision to inspire believers to live boldly for Christ in every aspect of life, including what they wear. <br /><em>“For we walk by faith, not by sight,” </em> <em><strong>(2 Corinthians 5:7)</strong>
    </em> Our mission is to create faith-inspired apparel that reminds you to trust God's path daily. <br /> Walk by Faith is more than just clothing it's a movement to declare our identity in Christ and share His love with the world. 
    <br />Each piece is crafted to reflect the truth and hope we have in Jesus. Together we walk in His light.</p2>
